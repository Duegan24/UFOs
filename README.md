# UFOs

## Challenge Overview
In this project, the objective was to create a simple website to display information from an object as a table and then dynamically filter the data based on user input.  Some of the key challeges were making it possible for the displayed table to be filtered by multiple filters.  In addition, I added the funtionality so a user could clear all of the filters without having to reload the webpage.

## Resources
- Data Source:  data.js (contained a limited data set of UFO events)
- Software:  JavaScript and HTML
- Libraries:  Bootstrap 4.0

## Recommendations for further development
Currently the filter fields are free text entry, this makes it challenging for the user requiring them to look through the list and type in the correctly formatted text.  It would be better for the date field to be a date picker and the text fields be a pull down list.  Additionally, it would be benifitical to be able to select a range of dates or multiple text criteria.  All of these elements would make the interface more user friendly and flexable.
